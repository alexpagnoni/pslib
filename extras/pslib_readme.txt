Overview
========
PSLib is a PHP library for generating PostScript files for the PHP free 
scripting language. It offers an easy way of generating PostScript text 
and graphics with (so far) limited support for drawing. Call PSlib
functions from within your PHP script and voila: dynamic PS files!

The functions should be quite self-explainable and somehow mimic the well
known proprietary PDFlib which generates dynamic PDF files. 

Take a look at History, and make the changes to your old code.


Supported Programming Environments
==================================
The PSLib was developed for usage within a PHP script only. Along with 
this distribution there is an example called historico.php3 where PSlib is
used.  


PSLib Features
==============
- basic drawing
  lines, rectangles, ...
- text
  text in different fonts and sizes, formatting,
  built-in font metrics, support for international (Latin, European) 
  character encoding (must have the included acentos.ps)         
- image file formats
  support for PostScript files (use the GPL software GIMP to generate or
  convert other well known graphic formats to PS) 


Supplied Library Clients
========================
TODO


Platform support
================
PSlib requires a working PHP environment and will run on any platform
that supports PHP.


Where to start?
